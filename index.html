    			<tr>
      			  <td> When it comes to digital artworks, there are two main categories: Raster Graphics and Vetor Graphics. Raster images are considered as the norm because they are seen in the normal images and photography. Basically, all the files which end in .jpg/.png/.tiff are all Raster. 
					
					  <br> <br> In contrary to the Raster Graphics, Vectors are made up of points, lines and curves which are all based on mathematical equations, rather than many solid coloured squared pixels like in Raster images. Their most common file names end in .ai/.eps/.svg. most of the logos that we see are all Vector files. As with many other things, there are various programs available for one to use. The main programs which are used by many Graphic designers are: Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw and Inkscape. My Vector Works which are shown on the right where all made with Adobe Illustrator.
					
					  <br> <br> <br> <h1> What are their Advantages?
									 </h1>
					
					  <br> <br> The main advantage of Vector Graphics is that the image can be scaled as big or as small as you like without effecting its definition. So, we say that these files have infinite resolution. We all know that if you scale up or down a Raster image it can become blurry and loose all its crispiness.   
				
					  <br> <br> We also say that Vector Graphics can be easily manipulated since it is extremely easy to change their size, colours, etc. They can also be animated, edited with coding and eventually they can also be made interactive.
					  
					  <br> <br> <br> <h1> What are their Disadvantages?
									 </h1>
					
					  <br> <br> The main disadvantages of Vector Graphics are that Vectors may not be suitable for complex images and that many a times in order for the graphics to be displayed online instead of printing, they would still need to be rasterized.
					  
					  <br> <br> <br> <h1> Artists of Reference
									 </h1>
					
					  <br> <br> This field is ever growing, so we are seeing various artists producing some top quality work in this area, perhaps the most famous users are Graphic Designers, Logo Makers and Printers.
					  <br> <br> My favourite artist in this field is Noma Bar. I really admire his simplicity and his fantastic choice of colours. I also like how he manages to interect different elements together in one artwork.
